Basic Properties:
(A+B) % p = (A%p + b%p) % p 
(A*B) % p = (A %p * B %p) %p 

However, this property does not hold for division.
E.g. (A / B) % P != A % P / B % P 

This is where mod multiplicative inverse comes in
We can turn (A/B) % P into (A * mod_inv) % P and use the multiplication property

Finding mod multiplicative inverse:
n * x = 1 % p

if (n % x == 0), n has no multiplicative inverse

mod inverse of n exists if GCD(n, p) = 1

E.g. Simplify (6/2)%5 
2 * x = 1 % 5
x = 3

now, ans = (6 % 5 * 3 % 5) % 5 = 3

Coding program to find mod inverse:

1. Fermat's Little Thm.

a^m-1 = 1  (mod m)
a^m-2 = a^-1 (mod m)
Therefore, a^m-2 % m = multiplicative inverse
